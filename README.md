# Colorful-Personal-Resume

This file contains a personal resume that shows the HTML and CSS skills I learned and practiced while reviewing Christina Truong's LinkedIn CSS Essential Training course. The resume is a responsive web design as it constricts and expands whenever the user interacts with the browser. HTML and CSS were the very first programming languages I learned, and I wanted to showcase the skills that I developed. I did face challenges with the responsive web design. As I followed Christina's course, I learned that applying the correct HTML tags and CSS selectors were the easiest part. However, ensure that the code made sense enough to respond with no errors was difficult. I do hope to continue practicing responsive web design as I create more complex web pages.

The project does not need to be installed.
