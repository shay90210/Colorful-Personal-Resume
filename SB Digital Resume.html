                    <h2>Frontend Developer + Learning Software Engineer + Teacher</h2>

                    <p>
                        As a self-taught Frontend developer and bootcamp student, I create projects that
                        include web development scripting languages such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
                        (ES6). I am currently learning MySQL, Microsoft Azure, responsive web design,
                        and the basics of algorithms/data structures to enhance those projects making
                        them more complex and accessible to technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a previous educator, I taught individuals of all age groups, differentiated
                        instruction for visual, auditorial, and kinesthetic learners, and developed
                        in-depth lesson plans that engaged learners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my free time, I love taking my dogs to the park to meet other dogs and
                        dog owners. I also believe in a clean house and dedicate myself to cleaning
                        every weekend. Plus, I know my way around a kitchen.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Smiley Face Matching Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        Styled with CSS, I created this game for my web fundamentals course where we had
                        to include the following JavaScript: variables, working functions that would
                        load the game immediately, DOM methods, while loops, and for loops.

                            <p>
                                I created a color guessing game with JavaScript as the programming language. The
                                guessing game demonstrates my understanding of loops, arrays, variables, and a
                                part of the DOM coding.

                            <p>
                                I designed this project using HTML and CSS based on what I've learned from the
                                LinkedIn trainings by instructors Jen Simmons (HTML) and Christina Truong (CSS).
                                I challenged myself using a variety of properties and selectors to make my
                                digital resume stand out. I used an outline prior to embedding the code into
                                Visual Studio Code. This project also features a basic understanding of
                                responsive web design.
